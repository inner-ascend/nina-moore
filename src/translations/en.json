      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm skeptical about 'energy work'?",
        "answer": "Good. You don't need to believe anything. We work with what you can feel—breath, sensation, emotion in your body. Whether you call it \"energy\" or \"nervous system regulation\" doesn't matter. The experience speaks for itself. Skeptics often become the biggest advocates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to have done psychedelics?",
        "answer": "Not at all. About half my clients have never touched plant medicine. The integration work applies to any breakthrough experience—spiritual awakening, major loss, relationship ending, creative breakthrough. If you have done medicine work, I provide specific integration support."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from traditional therapy?",
        "answer": "Traditional therapy often works primarily through talking and cognitive understanding. This work engages your body directly—breath, sensation, movement. We don't just talk about patterns, we work with the energy and emotion stored in your system. Many clients find things shift faster because we're working at multiple levels."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if we're not a good fit?",
