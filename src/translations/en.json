      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm skeptical about 'energy work'?",
        "answer": "That's fine. You don't need to believe anything. We work with what you can feel in your body—breath, sensation, emotion. The rest is just language for describing the experience. Skeptics often become the biggest advocates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to have done psychedelics?",
        "answer": "Not at all. About 60% of my clients have never touched plant medicine. This work stands completely on its own. Integration support is one specialization, not a requirement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from traditional therapy?",
        "answer": "We work with the body, not just the mind. Rather than analyzing your problems, we move through them using breath, somatic awareness, and energy work. Many clients say they've made more progress in a few sessions than years of talk therapy."
